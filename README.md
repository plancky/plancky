## Hi! I am Shashvat! 

I am a software engineer at 487 studios, where I am mostly involved in web development related work.

Some of my recent interests include game development, decentralized applications, neural networks, containerization and understanding internet infrastructure.

As of early 2025, I have started to read about western history, and I have been having fun playing basketball on the regular. 

Feel free to ping me at shashvat817@gmail.com if any of my work stands out or just to say Hi!
